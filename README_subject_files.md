# Data Organization
  *August 31, 2018*
  Subject folders are organized into two groups:
  1. subjects located in the main *HBN* directory have been run through the fmriprep anat      container and are now being run through the ciftify container

  2. subjects located in the subdirectory *tmp* within the *HBN* directory are being run through the fmriprep anat container. Once this step is complete, subject folders must be moved back into the main *HBN* directory in order to be run through the ciftify container
